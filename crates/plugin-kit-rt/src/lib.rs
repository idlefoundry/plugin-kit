//! Real-time scheduling for audio threads, for the plug-ins' workers, their labs and their
//! tests: the threads that process audio (a host's callback thread, a voice's workers) wake
//! every block and must not wait behind ordinary work. Taken from the real-time threads of
//! the DAW the first models were developed in; since then, inside a host's process, its
//! watchdog watches only the threads promoted here, Windows's threads join MMCSS, the flush
//! bits travel (the CA-72's decisions.md R18); from the CA-74, a [`Backoff`] that waits
//! without holding a CPU; from the MC-79, macOS's threads demoted too (its R13).
//!
//! - macOS: the Mach time-constraint policy, with the block period;
//! - Linux: `SCHED_FIFO`, which needs an rtprio allowance (`/etc/security/limits.conf`,
//!   rtkit or the `audio` group); without it the thread stays as it was;
//! - Windows: MMCSS's "Pro Audio" task at critical priority, as hosts' audio threads are
//!   (time-critical thread priority where MMCSS refuses), left when the thread ends.
//!
//! On Linux a thread at `SCHED_FIFO` that never stops (an overloaded engine, a bug)
//! keeps everything below its priority off its CPU, the kernel's interrupt threads
//! included; where the system's real-time throttling is off (`sched_rt_runtime_us` equal
//! to the period, as on the owner's machine) nothing stops it, and the machine stalls.
//! So a watchdog watches the threads promoted here ([`demotions`]): while any is alive, a
//! thread on each CPU at ordinary priority beats every 50 ms, and a thread above the audio
//! threads looks every 100 ms; when a CPU's beat is [`STARVED`] old while one of them runs
//! there, every thread promoted here is made ordinary (`SCHED_OTHER`), and it is counted
//! and said on stderr. The audio then runs on, late if it must, and the machine answers.
//! Never the host's own audio threads or another plug-in's: only threads promoted here.
//! With none alive, the watchdog's threads sleep until one is.
