# baseview, patched

The `baseview` crate from [RustAudio/baseview](https://github.com/RustAudio/baseview) at
commit `9a0b42c09d712777b2edb4c5e0cb6baf21e988f0` (MIT OR Apache-2.0, `LICENSE-MIT`,
`LICENSE-APACHE`), the revision the editor took from git until 0.1.0. The examples, the CI
and the manifest's `[workspace]`, `[[example]]` and `[dev-dependencies]` tables are left
out; the manifest names the repository, for the notices, and allows two of upstream's own
compiler warnings (`non_snake_case` in `src/win/drop_target.rs`, and
`mismatched_lifetime_syntaxes`). `src/macos/window.rs` has one `use` list in the order
today's rustfmt gives it, so that `cargo fmt --all` leaves the tree as it is.

Three changes, all for Windows only, in `src/win/window.rs`, `src/win/drop_target.rs`,
`src/event.rs` and `src/window.rs` (the CA-72's `docs/decisions.md` R26, R28 and R34):

1. **The window procedure never calls the handler while it is busy.** baseview keeps the
   window's handler in a `RefCell` and borrows it for each event. A message can be sent to
   the window from within one of the handler's own calls: a VST3 host may resize the
   editor's window from within `IPlugFrame::resizeView()`, which the editor asks for from its
   event handler; `SetFocus` sends focus messages; a modal loop dispatches the window's
   messages. For any such message `wnd_proc` ran the deferred tasks (a resize the handler
   had asked for: `SetWindowPos`, so a `WM_SIZE`), and `WM_SIZE` borrowed the handler again:
   a panic inside the window procedure, which cannot unwind, so the host's process aborted
   (0xC0000409). The CA-72 0.1.0 did this in Sonar as its presets' drawer opened. Now:
   - an event that arrives while the handler is busy waits in a queue (`pending_events`),
     and a frame then is skipped;
   - the waiting events, then the deferred tasks, run only when the handler is not busy: in
     the `wnd_proc` call whose handler call has just returned (or after a drag and drop
     event). Each in its order; an event waiting is given before a task asked for earlier
     runs (a `Resize` after the `Resized` of a host's `WM_SIZE`), which is harmless;
   - `Window::focus()` is a deferred task, as upstream did in
     [#252](https://github.com/RustAudio/baseview/pull/252) (2026-05-25): "a panic will
     occur when calling `Window.focus` while handling events";
   - `WM_MOUSEMOVE` no longer keeps the pointer's "outside" flag borrowed across the
     handler's call;
   - a drag and drop event that finds the handler busy is dropped and the drop refused;
   - each `wnd_proc` call holds a reference to the window's state until it returns. Closing
     the window (`DestroyWindow` for `BV_WINDOW_MUST_CLOSE`) sends `WM_NCDESTROY` from within
     the call, which freed the state while that call still read it afterwards (upstream
     did, through its deferred tasks), and a host destroying its window while the handler
     was busy freed the handler under its own borrow. `WM_NCDESTROY` also empties both
     queues.

   #252 alone does not do: a host that resizes the editor's window from within
   `resizeView()` still delivered `WM_SIZE` to the busy handler (the CA-72's tests
   `the_drawer_opens_and_shuts_where_the_host_resizes_the_editors_window` and
   `the_grip_resizes_where_the_host_resizes_the_editors_window` abort with #252's change
   only).

2. **The handler is told when Windows asks for the window to be drawn again.** baseview left
   `WM_PAINT` to `DefWindowProcW`, which validates the window without drawing anything, and
   told the handler nothing. Whatever invalidates the window (a host repainting its own, a
   capture with `PrintWindow`) has Windows ask, and a parent window without
   `WS_CLIPCHILDREN` (a dialog, as a host's may be) has by then painted its background over
   it; a handler that draws only when its frame changes, as the CA-72's editor does, left
   that there (in REAPER's FX window, 240, 240, 240, until something in the panel changed). Now
   `WM_PAINT` gives the handler a new event, `WindowEvent::Damaged`, as any event is given
   (queued while the handler is busy, and given once its call returns), and `DefWindowProcW`
   then validates what the handler has not drawn (softbuffer validates the window as it
   presents). Nothing else sends it: macOS keeps a window's pixels, and on X11 baseview
   ignores `Expose` (the CA-72's editor shows its frame again every 250 ms there, R19).

   The CA-72's test `the_panel_is_shown_again_as_windows_repaints_its_window` fails without
   this change (the host's background left on the editor's window).

3. **The window takes every key while its handler holds the keyboard.** A host's window may be
   a dialog (REAPER's FX window is), whose message loop asks the window with the keyboard
   which keys it takes (`WM_GETDLGCODE`) and keeps the others for itself; baseview left that
   to `DefWindowProcW`, which takes none of them. So with the CA-72's presets' drawer or MIDI
   Learn holding the keyboard, REAPER 7.82 on Windows moved its focus to one of its own buttons
   at an arrow key, and the drawer's list never had it. Now `Window::set_wants_keys(true)`
   has the window answer `DLGC_WANTALLKEYS` (and the arrows, Tab and characters), and `false`,
   the default, leaves the question to `DefWindowProcW` as before, so that the dialog keeps its
   keys while the handler does not want them. On macOS and X11 the call does nothing. (REAPER
   keeps Escape whatever the window answers, and closes its FX window, unless the plug-in's
   "Send all keyboard input to plug-in" is on.)

   The CA-72's test `the_editor_asks_a_dialog_for_every_key_only_while_it_holds_them` checks
   the answer with the drawer and a control's menu open and shut.

Upstream's master has since rewritten the Windows backend and the handler's interface; to
move to it, the editor must be ported, and the tests above show whether it still needs this.
The rewrite tells its handler of each `WM_PAINT` and draws then (`WindowHandler::damage`,
[#344](https://github.com/RustAudio/baseview/pull/344), 2026-10-04), as the second change does.
